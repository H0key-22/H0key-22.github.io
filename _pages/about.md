I’m currently an undergraduate at Fudan University, passionately exploring the frontiers of AI. My research focuses on multimodal large-language models and advanced LLM reasoning techniques. I’m highly self-motivated and always eager to dive into inspiring new challenges. Lately, I’ve been especially excited about leveraging reinforcement learning to push the reasoning capabilities of LLMs even further.


<!-- My industry experience includes being a research intern at **Microsoft Research Asia** and **Megvii (Face++)**, where I collaborated with [Dr. Jingdong Wang](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/), [Dr. Gang Yu](https://www.skicyyu.org/), and [Dr. Jian Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALVSZAYAAAAJ&hl=en). I was part of the winning team at the COCO & Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation Challenge 2018. -->
