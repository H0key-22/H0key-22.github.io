**Welcome!**

I’m a senior student at **Fudan University** under the guidance of [Prof. Zhongyu Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AjLDxxgAAAAJ) at **Fudan Disc Lab**, passionately exploring the frontiers of AI. Currently, I am working as a intern at **Blender Lab** at **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**
 under the supervision of [Prof. Heng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=z7GCqT4AAAAJ).

My research focuses on multimodal large-language models and advanced LLM reasoning techniques. I’m highly self-motivated and always eager to dive into inspiring new challenges. My research interests lies in **tool learning, RL for reasoning and multimodality**. Lately, I’ve been especially excited about leveraging reinforcement learning to push the reasoning capabilities of LLMs even further.

Feel free to reach out to me to explore potential research opportunities together.
